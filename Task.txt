--- FIX "git is not recognized" ERROR ---

1. Check if Git is installed:
   Open Command Prompt and run:
   git --version

   - If you see "git is not recognized", Git is either not installed or not in PATH.

2. Install Git (if not installed):
   - Download from: https://git-scm.com/downloads
   - Run the installer.
   - During installation, select "Add Git to PATH".
   - After installation, open Command Prompt and run:
     git --version

3. If Git is already installed but not working:
   - Open Windows Search → type: Environment Variables → select "Edit the system environment variables".
   - In System Properties → Environment Variables.
   - Under System Variables, find "Path" → Edit.
   - Add the following paths (adjust if Git is in another folder):
        C:\Program Files\Git\bin
        C:\Program Files\Git\cmd
   - Click OK → restart Command Prompt.

4. Verify installation:
   Run in Command Prompt:
   git --version
   You should see something like: git version 2.x.x

Tip: You can also use Git Bash (installed with Git) for Linux-style commands.
